Software engineer at LeapMind, Inc.

## I am ...

* SIMD / vectorization enthusiast, good at C with x86\_64 intrinsics.
  * enjoying re-designing and tuning various algorithms for modern rich processors (with OoO, SIMD, and multi-level cache).
* Recently getting used to: Rust and Arm64 assembly.
* Sometimes work with Python, C++, shellscript, R, and so on...

## Works

### Software

* **[ge](https://github.com/ocxtal/ge)**: a tool to edit multiple text files at once in a single editor pane.
* **[insn_bench_aarch64](https://github.com/ocxtal/insn_bench_aarch64)**: instruction latency-and-throuput profiler for Armv8 A64 processors.
* **[Udon](https://github.com/ocxtal/udon)**: a library for compact on-memory representation and fast streamed decoding of DNA sequence alignments; mainly for drawing pileups.
* **[dozeu](https://github.com/ocxtal/dozeu)**: SIMD-parallel protein and DNA sequence alignment library; Smith-Waterman-Gotoh extension on genome graphs with X-drop banding.
* **[libgaba](https://github.com/ocxtal/libgaba)**: SIMD-parallel DNA sequence alignment library; Smith-Waterman-Gotoh extension with adaptive banding. ([https://doi.org/10.1186/s12859-018-2014-8](https://doi.org/10.1186/s12859-018-2014-8))
* **[tinymasker](https://github.com/ocxtal/tinymasker)**: demonstration of de Bruijn index, a faster alternative to hash-table- or suffix-array-based fixed-length string matching indices.
* **[minialign](https://github.com/ocxtal/minialign)**: an experimental seed-and-extend DNA alignment tool, demonstration of fast dynamic programming implementation of libgaba.
* **[xd](https://github.com/ocxtal/xd)**: ultrafast binary dump, SIMD-vectorized. for inspecting and debugging huge binary objects.
* **[rbread.h](https://github.com/ocxtal/rbread)**: transparent reader for gzip, bz2, and xz.

### Hardware / Embedded

* **[vfdc](https://github.com/ocxtal/vfdc)**: table clock firmware and driver for NEC LD8035 VFD tubes ([an article in Japanese](https://qiita.com/ocxtal/items/3816ec1c6df2d1c86bde)).

* **[ledblinker](https://github.com/ocxtal/ledblinker)**: an exercise on Verilog HDL and Datapath modules on PSoC5LP.
* **[psocburn](https://bitbucket.org/suzukihajime/psocburn)**: FT232H-powered PSoC 1/3/5LP firmware flasher (forked from [picburn](http://arms22.blog91.fc2.com/blog-entry-151.html); archived)

### Miscellaneous
